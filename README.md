See the [`data` directory](./data) for more information on the datasets used by this project. 

## After Cloning This Repository

After cloning this repository locally, be sure to be inside of this project and then execute the `./configure-repo.sh` script. This will ensure that Git does not allow you to commit output to any `*.ipynb` files.

This requires that when you make a commit, you have access to the `jupyter` command. If you get error messages upon adding `*.ipynb` files, ensure that you have the `jupyter` command accessible at the time that you are adding/committing changes to this project.
