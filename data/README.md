# Data Sets

The datasets used for this project should be placed directly in this directory.


## Citations

All of the data used comes from the [2021 CS1 Keystroke Data](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/BVOF7S). This dataset was generated from students taking a CS1 course during the fall 2021 semester at Utah State University. The important files, discussed below in the [Data File Map](#data-file-map) section, are found in this data set and are to be unzipped and manually placed in this directory. This dataset contains a `readme.txt` file which can be used to understand the format of some of the `.csv` files used by this project.
